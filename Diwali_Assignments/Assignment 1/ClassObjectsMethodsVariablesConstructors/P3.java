		central Idea: 
			whenever there is requirement like without existing a class there is no point of existing other class 
			in that case we can use inner classes. here no point of existing Department class without University class.
			Addition to this if our requirement is that the dependent class can have different instances in that 
			case we declare inner(dependent class) instance. here Department class may have various departments.
