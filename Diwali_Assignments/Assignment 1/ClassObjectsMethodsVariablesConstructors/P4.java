		central Idea: 
			whenever requirement is of such type in which to user want to use inner class without help 
			any reference of outer class then we can go for static inner classes(when trying to use 
			from some other outside class)
			we can also declare static methods inside static inner class which is not possible in instance 
			inner class.
